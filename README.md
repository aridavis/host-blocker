# Host Entry Blocker

## What is this?

This is a program which I make to help my uncle block some websites during his children's online school time.

## Config

1. Open config folder
2. To view the current password, open password file. You can also change the password manually
3. Open the .env file, and change your own configuration

Feel free to use this program
